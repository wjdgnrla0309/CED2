## Integration Methods

- **Q. What is the difference between Real Time Type and DB Cache Type?**
    
    **Real Time Type**
    
    - Calls ONDA API in real-time whenever a customer searches
    - No need to store inventory/rates in DB
    - No Webhook development required
    - Relatively simple implementation
    
    **DB Cache Type**
    
    - Stores all product inventory/rates in channel DB
    - Queries own DB when customers search (fast response)
    - Webhook development required (real-time updates)
    - Advantageous for high-volume traffic handling
    
    For more details, refer to:
    
    - [Real Time Type](/docs/api/channel/realtime-type)
    - [DB Cache Type](/docs/api/channel/db-cache-type)
- **Q. What is Webhook and when is it needed?**
    
    **What is Webhook?**
    
    A push-based API that notifies channels in real-time when information changes in ONDA.
    
    **Webhook Types**
    
    - `contents_updated`: Property/room/package content change notification
    - `status_updated`: Product addition or sales status change notification
    - `inventory_updated`: Rate/inventory change notification
    
    **When Needed**
    
    - **Required for DB Cache Type integration**
    - Optional for Real Time Type
    
    For more details, refer to [Webhook Overview](/docs/api/channel/webhook-overview).
    
- **Q. What is the difference between ONDA → Vendor and Vendor → ONDA methods?**
    
    Vendor API provides two integration methods:
    
    **ONDA → Vendor (Pull method)**
    
    - ONDA calls the Vendor system’s API
    - Real-time data synchronization
    - Vendor provides API and responds
    
    **Vendor → ONDA (Push method)**
    
    - Vendor calls ONDA API to update information
    - Sends immediately when changes occur
    - ONDA receives and stores data
    
    In most cases, both methods are used together.

### API Integration Process

> Step-by-step ONDA API integration process guide
> 

# API Integration Process

## 1. Check Integration Method

To obtain preliminary information about the integration method according to the channel’s service, check the following:

- Do they store and service rates and inventory? Or do they call from the client each time for service?
- Is the channel’s service type a metasearch platform? Or an OTA vertical service?

## 2. Review API Documentation

After completing the NDA, deliver the API documentation to the channel for review.

## 3. Pre-development Meeting

Once API documentation review is complete, hold a general integration guide meeting. Through this meeting, synchronize on the following:

- [Channel > ONDA] Review the channel’s service they want to integrate.
- [ONDA > Channel] Guide through the overall integration process.
- [ONDA > Channel] Estimate and synchronize approximate development schedule.

## 4. Integration Development

Integration development direction is determined by two service types. This is guided through information obtained in ‘1. Check Integration Method’.
The biggest difference between types is the processing method for ‘inventory and rates’.

You can check the Sequence Diagrams for the two service types below.

- [DB Cache Type](ref:db-cache-type)
- [Real Time Type](ref:real-time-type)

## 5. Testing

Conduct API testing in both ONDA and the sales channel’s development environments.

- Product registration
- Rate and inventory synchronization
- Reservation testing
- Webhook testing

## 6. Live Deployment

After testing in the development environment is complete, deploy to both parties’ production environments, register actual products, and start sales.

---

### Authorization

> ONDA API authorization key guide
> 

# Authorization

## Authorization Key?

An authorization key is required to call ONDA’s API.
Authorization keys are divided into development environment keys and production environment keys, and are issued in stages and shared separately by your account manager.

## Development (Dev) Authorization Key

The development environment authorization key is provided after signing an NDA with ONDA or completing the initial contract.

## Production (Live) Authorization Key

The production environment authorization key is provided along with the production environment host domain once development and testing in the development environment are completed.
It is never provided before testing in the development environment is completed.

---

### Real Time Type

> Integration type with real-time API calls
> 

# Real Time Type

Real Time Type checks inventory and rate information in real-time by calling the ONDA API whenever an event occurs in the service client. Channels can provide service without needing to store inventory and rates in their database.

## Content Synchronization

Channel DB Cache is the initial synchronization step where you retrieve and store Property, Roomtype, and Rateplan information. Subsequently, content updated in ONDA can be received through Webhooks.

## Inventory Updates

You can receive inventory updates in real-time using Search Property. At this time, properties (Property ID) are limited to a maximum of 200, with 50 commonly recommended. Develop considering your channel’s response speed.

### DB Cache Type

> Integration type that stores inventory/rates in database
> 

# DB Cache Type

DB Cache Type refers to a format that stores rates and inventory for all sales products in the channel’s database before providing service.
In this case, **Webhook development is required** to update rates and inventory in real-time.

### Image Contents

> Image content storage and resize guide
> 

# Image Contents

## Image Content Storage

- Images provided by ONDA must be separately stored and used by the channel itself. (e.g., S3)
- This API basically stores property information, room information, rates/inventory, images, etc. in the channel’s own database.

## Image Resize

- The images provided by default are original files.
- If the image size is too large and burdensome, process in the following order.
- You can successfully call by changing the `original` part at the end of the image URL to the appropriate size below.
- Available sizes are 1000, 500, 150, original. `1000 size is recommended.`

## Image Samples

**original size** (default)

- [https://image.tport.io/extranet/properties/117417/2869cc0d-c7ec-f2af-bb72-8715b2e5acca-original.jpg](https://image.tport.io/extranet/properties/117417/2869cc0d-c7ec-f2af-bb72-8715b2e5acca-original.jpg)

### Cancellation Policy

> Cancellation and refund policy guide
> 

# Cancellation Policy

> ❗️
> 
> 
> The cancellation policy at search time and **the actual cancellation policy for bookings may differ**.
> Please follow this guide to prevent any claims.
> 

## Key Summary

- **Two policies exist**: Static Policy (for search) and Dynamic Policy (actually applied)
- **Cancellations use Dynamic Policy**: Dynamic Policy is applied when canceling a reservation
- **Check before booking**: Always query Dynamic Policy before payment and inform the customer

## Two Cancellation Policies

ONDA’s cancellation policy is divided into **Static Policy** and **Dynamic Policy**.

| Category | Static Policy | Dynamic Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Purpose** | Display in search results | Applied at actual cancellation |
| **Characteristics** | Property-level default (conservative) | Actual policy by room/time |
| **API** | [Search Property Detail](check-availabilities-rates) | [Cancellation & Refund Policy before reservation](cancellation-refund-policy-before-reservation) |
| **Field** | `refund_policy` object | `refund_policy` object |

## Static Policy

A **default policy** set at the property level, displaying the most conservative cancellation policy.

- **API**:
    - `refund_policy` object in [Search Property Detail](check-availabilities-rates)
    - `property_refunds` object in [Get Property Detail](get-property-detail) (same value)
- **Purpose**: Provide approximate cancellation policy in search results
- **Note**: May differ from the policy applied at actual cancellation

> ⚠️ **Caution**
> 
> 
> Do not provide customers with a confirmed cancellation policy based on Static Policy alone.
> Cancellation fees and refund amounts may differ at actual cancellation.
> 

## Dynamic Policy

The **actual cancellation policy** for the room the customer wants to book. It may vary by room, date, and time.

- **API**: `refund_policy` object in [Cancellation & Refund Policy before reservation](cancellation-refund-policy-before-reservation)
- **Purpose**: Check the actual policy to be applied just before booking
- **Application**: This policy is applied when the customer cancels

> 💡 **Key Point**
> 
> 
> **Dynamic Policy is always applied** when canceling a reservation.
> 

## Implementation Guide

Partners should handle cancellation policies with the following flow:

### Step 1: Display Search Results

```
API: Search Property Detail
Display: Static Policy (for reference)
```

- Provide approximate cancellation policy in search results
- Recommended text: “Cancellation policy may change at time of booking”

### Step 2: Check Before Booking

```
API: Cancellation & Refund Policy before reservation
Display: Dynamic Policy (actually applied)
```

- Must be called before payment to check the actual cancellation policy
- Clearly inform the customer of this policy

### Step 3: Process Cancellation

```
Applied: Dynamic Policy
```

- Cancellation fees/refunds are processed according to Dynamic Policy

## Channel API - Webhook
================================================================================

### Webhook Overview

> ONDA Webhook API overview and setup guide
> 

# Webhook Overview

## Webhook?

This is an API used to enable real-time updates of content, rates, and inventory information for properties, room types, and packages changed in ONDA GDS to channels.

The default Method for Webhook API sent from ONDA is `PUT`.

## Webhook Types

| Webhook | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `contents_updated` | Webhook that notifies **that content information** of properties, room types, and package plans has changed. |
| `status_updated` | Webhook that notifies **information about newly added** properties, room types, and package plans or **changed sales status information**. |
| `inventory_updated` | Webhook that **notifies rate and inventory information** for a specific date of a specific package plan. |

## Webhook Setup Process

1. The channel selects which type of Webhook API spec to develop.
2. The channel develops based on the Webhook API spec provided by ONDA.
3. Share Webhook API environment information such as API domain and Auth Key with ONDA.
4. ONDA sets the shared environment information and deploys it.
5. Execute updated items for each item and test mutually.

### POST /properties/{property_id}/bookings — Create Reservation

#### ⚠️ `400 channel booking number is exist already` 수신 시 처리 안내

동일 `channel_booking_number`로 예약 생성 요청이 중복 수신되면 반환되는 에러입니다.
즉시 결제 취소 등 실패 처리를 하지 마시고, 아래 절차로 실제 예약 상태를 재확인해 주세요.

1. 수신한 `channel_booking_number`로 **Check Reservation API**를 호출 (`type=channel_booking_number` 쿼리 파라미터 사용)
2. 응답에 예약 정보가 존재하면 **예약 성공**으로 간주하고 내부 상태를 동기화
3. 예약 정보가 없으면 실제 실패이므로 결제 취소 등 통상적인 실패 처리를 진행
